# Security System based on AI

## Use case

This piece of software is useful if you want to integrate AI applications in your own house/business security cameras. 

It is based on Langchain so it is quite versatile in terms of model selection. You can pass from one to other without needing to change one line of code.

Basically, it analyzes in real time if the camera detects a human around the property. If it is detected, it triggers another LLM that analyzes if the human that appears is trying to enter in the place or not. Based on that, it will call the police or turn on the alarm
